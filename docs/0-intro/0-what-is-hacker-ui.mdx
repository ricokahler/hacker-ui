# What is Hacker UI?

Hacker UI is a **design system** for the **modern developer**.

## Why a design system for developers?

**As developers,** certain ideas transform us into "hackers" who stop at nothing in order to bring their ideas to life.

In this state, we don't always care about how things look. What we care about the most is finding the right set of tools that allows us to get the job done.

This is the main goal of Hacker UI — **to be the hacker's go-to design system**.

## What makes this design system different?

Design systems are typically coupled with a company's branding.

So much so that building a product with that system can make it look like your product is the work of that company. This is where Hacker UI is completely different.

Instead of trying to be distinct brand, **Hacker UI simply tries to blend in and look good.**

This system's brand is no brand.

## Why should I use this system?

It's small, easy to learn, and just what you need in order to bring your idea to life <Emoji label="heart">❤️</Emoji>.

Poke around in the examples and try it yourself.
