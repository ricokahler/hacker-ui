This describes the idealogy and principles of Hacker UI.

# Design ISMs

## Unbranded

As stated in [the previous doc](./what-is-hacker-ui), Hacker UI's brand is no brand. This way your idea doesn't come with a company's brand attached.

Hacker UI uses system fonts, generic shadows, and flat controls and still looks great!

## Simple

Simple means only having a small but useful set of rules and choices.

It's easy to build UIs with Hacker UI because you only have a handful of typography classes, sizes, and spacing units.

## Responsive

In this context, "responsive" goes beyond responsive web design.

UIs created with Hacker UI should respond to all user interactions. This can be from darkening the color of a button when you hover over it to automatically rearranging the layout as the browser window gets smaller.

# Development ISMs

## Lean

Embrace CSS. Convention > Abstraction.

## Atomic

Build up UIs from smaller parts. Prefer more atomic components over less complex ones

## Composable

and open
