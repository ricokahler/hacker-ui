- accent — branded accent color, primarily used for controls
- danger — for errors, danger text is fine but use it seldomly
- warning — for warnings, use this for icon colors but not text
- info — semantic info color, use this like warning. don't make "info" buttons
- bland — semantic default color, use this for plain controls and dividers. this is

- surface (dynamic)
- contrast (dynamic)

- current (dynamic)
